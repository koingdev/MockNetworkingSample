# MockNetworkingSample
Unit Testing by mocking a network response + Nimble including with a quick MVVM Concept

> Why should we mock Networking Layer while writing a test ?
- To simulate different scenarios
- The test stop depending on the Network Condition
- No more server communication
- Flexibility to write a test in various situations that may not be so easy to reproduce if we write a test that talk to a real server
